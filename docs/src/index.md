# RMS - Reaction Mechanism Simulator

RMS is a Julia package designed for simulating and analyzing large chemical reaction mechanisms.  

## Features

* Ideal gas and dilute liquid phases.  
* Constant T and P and constant V adiabatic ideal gas reactors.  
* Constant T and V dilute liquid reactors.  
* Diffusion limited rates.
* Sensitivity analysis for all reactors.  
* Flux diagrams with molecular images (if molecular information is provided).  
* Handy plotting and other solution analysis tools.  
* Easy to add new features.
